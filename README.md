This project was bootstrapped with [Truffle Unbox](https://github.com/truffle-box/react-box).

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:
1. Run the `unbox` command via `npx` and skip to step 3. This will install all necessary dependencies. A Create-React-App is generated in the `client` directory.
   ```js
   npx truffle unbox react
   ```

2. Alternatively, you can install Truffle globally and run the `unbox` command.
    ```javascript
    npm install -g truffle
    truffle unbox react
    ```

3. Run the development console.
    ```javascript
    truffle develop
    ```



4. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.
    ```javascript
    compile
    migrate
    ```
