    "content": "Our children are registered by social workers who are the bridges between the real world and the virtual world. They regularly update children's needs on the SAY panel and ensure the product/service is received by the child on a weekly basis. All the social workers and children are authorized by registered local NGOs that are in partnership with SAY. On the other side, users get the chance to match with a child by two different methods and create a virtual family for a child by choosing the role of becoming a Mother, a Father, an Aunt, or an Uncle. Children's identities are kept confidential, however, we assign a unique avatar to every single child along with their real voice and life story."

    "content": "We aim to present all transactions and receipts on a blockchain. However, at this stage, we are providing up to 4 receipts for any transactions done for each need in our off-chain app. Including bank transfers, purchase receipts, NGO receipts, and receipts by the social workers monitoring the delivery of all the products/services to each child. SAY off-chain app is accessible by everyone and as you may already know, not all the international banks can make transactions with Iranian banks. This is another reason why we are shifting SAY App to a dapp (decentralized app) where communities and smart contracts are the decision-makers rather than individuals."

All the products listed on SAY are from online retailers that pay us commission fees on any purchase through our app, which accumulates up to 15% of the purchased price. Our second model is the donations we receive from our users and, SAY does not take any fee or percentage from products/services purchased or got done for the children."
